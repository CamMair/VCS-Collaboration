To go alongside the users reviews we will also have a section where customers can submit travel stories.
Here they can talk about their experience with TravelHub and our customer service.
On top of this they will be able to add photos and videos to showcase their trip.
Finally there will be a star rating system that allows the customer to rate their trip and give a comment on their decision. For example if they recommend it.
Adding this will allow us to show a community of people who have enjoyed holidays through TravelHub.
